To set up signed commits on mac:

- `gpg --gen-key` to generate the key

- `gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG` to list your key plus its long key (after the slash after the 2048 or 4096 bit length)

- `gpg --armor --export <PASTE_LONG_KEY_HERE> |pbcopy` to copy to public key your clipboard so you can paste it in [your profile](https://github.com/settings/keys).

- `git config --global user.signingkey <PASTE_LONG_KEY_HERE>` and `git config --global commit.gpgsign true` to add the key to your git config so you will be signing **all your commits** using that key. Make sure you want that setting to be global, or per git repo. 

- add `echo 'export GPG_TTY=$(tty)'` to your `.bash_profile` or your `.zshrc`.
this will make git ask you for your gpg passhprase *every* time you commit, to have it remembered, do the following:

- The following is specific for macs and will add the passphrase to your keychain so you won't be asked every time:

```
brew upgrade gnupg
brew link --overwrite gnupg
brew install pinentry-mac
echo "pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
killall gpg-agent
```
Try `echo "test" | gpg --clearsign` for it to ask for your passphrase so it can be added to keychain. In the popup window make sure you tick the box to add to keychain.
